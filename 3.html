    The third season of Rick and Morty,
an American animated television series created by Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland,
originally aired on Cartoon Network's late night programming block, Adult Swim.
It premiered with "The Rickshank Rickdemption", which aired unannounced on April 1,
2017, as part of Adult Swim's annual April Fools' prank. As a result of production delays,
the remaining episodes began airing weekly nearly four months later, on July 30, 2017.
The season comprised ten episodes, and its initial airing concluded on October 1, 2017.
